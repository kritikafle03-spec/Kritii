        <h3>Our Story: Where Luxury Meets the Highest Peak</h3>
        <p>
            The Snow Peak Mountain Resort is built near the magnificent MOUNT EVEREST. We wanted to create a place where the mountain's amazing beauty meets the very best in comfort and style.
        </p>
        <p>
            This resort is a special project, made to be a safe, warm, and beautiful base for people who love this powerful mountain. We use smart, modern building design to keep you warm and safe, even with the extreme weather outside. Our main goal is to give you a private, peaceful, and super-luxurious stay.

        <h4>Perfect Rooms, Amazing Views</h4>
        <p>
            Our rooms, like the Deluxe Rooms, Family Suites, and romantic Couples Room, are private havens. Everything is top-quality—from the comfortable beds to the beautiful stone and wood design. Every room has special climate control and oxygen systems to keep you comfortable at this high altitude. You will have huge windows with clear, stunning views of Mount Everest right from your room.
        </p>

        <h4>World-Class Food</h4>
        <p>
            Eating here is an adventure. Our main restaurant, "The Skyward Table", prepares high-quality food from the best ingredients, brought in fresh. You can also relax at the stylish "Aura Bar" for a drink or grab a hot coffee and a pastry at "The Glacier Cafe". All places have beautiful mountain views.
